    <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Event organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject content, posts, examples and other event contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>

    <p>This Code of Conduct applies both within event spaces and in public spaces (physical and virtual) when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting to, sharing or referencing official social media channels.</p>

    <h3>Enforcement</h3>

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>

    <p>Event participants who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.</p>
